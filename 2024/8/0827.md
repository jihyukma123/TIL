# 네이티브 개발 과정에 대해서 공부해야되는 것들

레딧 글을 보다가 도움이 되는 댓글이 있어서 기록해둔다.

As you build more and more complex applications, every now and again you come across requirements where you need to touch the native side, so you just learn as you go. It’s hard to say ‘this is what you need to know’.

Generally, you gain a good understanding of the native build systems when you want to achieve something that’s not out of the box with react native.

How to run a pre-build script in ios, set up different build targets, custom environment files etc. Add custom build flavors on android, have custom signing for your builds.

I would say it’s all about configuration rather than actual native code. Like yeah, sometimes you need to add a native line of code but anyone can do that.

What’s harder is ‘we want to build a separate app version for our UK users specifically - it needs to have a different bundle id, name and icon, it should connect to a different api and we want to be able to disable features remotely. On startup the app should check where you are and you can only access this app if you’re in the UK’. This is a problem that requires configuration and JS changes. You need to have a custom .env, a custom target and scheme, need to change the name and bundleid for a target/scheme and then some javascript.

So the thing you actually need to learn is xcode itself on iOS, on android it’s really just the 2 build.gradle files. It’s just about knowing how the build system works and where to find things, how to plug them in.

요약하자면 iOS/Android에서 앱을 configure 하는 방법 및 관련된 환경설정에 대한 이해가 도움이 된다는 것.

근래에 로고 교체 등 작업을 하면서 설정을 만질일이 조금씩 있었는데 이 댓글이 많이 와닿았다.

필요하다면 자연스럽게 플랫폼 별로 프로덕션 환경에 필요한 설정을 할 수 있어야 함.

아래와 같은 공식문서를 참고해보고, 플랫폼별로 앱을 실제로 네이티브하게 만들어본다던지 하는 과정이 있으면 좋겠다.
